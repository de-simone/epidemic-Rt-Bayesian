# epidemic-Rt-Bayesian
Real-time Bayesian calculation of the effective reproduction number.

This simple Python notebook outlines the calculation of the posterior distribution of the
effective reproduction number during an epidemic.

It allows one to marginalize over the parameters of the  serial interval distribution and 
over the parameters of the distribution of undetected cases.
