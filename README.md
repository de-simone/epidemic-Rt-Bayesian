# epidemic-Rt-Bayesian
Real-time Bayesian calculation of the effective reproduction number.

This simple Python notebook outlines the calculation of the posterior distribution of the
effective reproduction number of an epidemic.

It allows one to marginalize over the parameters of the 
serial interval distribution and over the parameters of the distribution of undetected cases.
